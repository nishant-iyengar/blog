# Cursor Configuration

## CRITICAL: Auto-commit and Push Rule

**[MANDATORY - AUTOMATIC]** After completing ANY changes or tasks in this repository, you MUST AUTOMATICALLY run the blog command WITHOUT being asked or reminded:

```bash
blog "brief description of changes"
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- This MUST be done automatically after EVERY change
- Do NOT wait for the user to remind you
- Do NOT ask if you should run it - just do it
- The description should be limited to 100 characters and summarize the changes made

Example:
```bash
blog "update photos component"
```

**Failure to run this command automatically will result in incomplete work.**
